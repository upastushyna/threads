# Java Multithreading Practice

This repository contains hands-on examples and experiments with **threads**, **multithreading**, and **concurrency** in Java. The goal is to deepen understanding of core Java concurrency mechanisms, thread safety, synchronization, and common patterns.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

- Basic thread creation using `Thread` and `Runnable`
- Thread lifecycle and management
- Synchronization and locks
- Shared resource access and race conditions
- `synchronized` blocks and methods
- `volatile` keyword
- `ExecutorService` and thread pools
- `Callable` and `Future`
- `ReentrantLock`, `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, `Semaphore`
- Deadlocks and how to avoid them
- Atomic operations with `java.util.concurrent.atomic`

## 🧪 Structure

Each topic is separated into its own package or class, with:
- Simple examples
- Test cases or main methods to demonstrate behavior
- Comments explaining the key concepts

## 📚 Requirements

- Java 17 or newer (recommended Java 21)
- Gradle or Maven (optional, depending on project structure)
- IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE
